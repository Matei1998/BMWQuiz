# BMWQuiz
This is a 8 questions quiz about BMW brand and their cars.
I used NETBeans IDE to create the interface for the quiz. 
To check the questions answered by the users, I used Java( OOP Principles, Constructors, looping, etc )
The QUIZ opens with a Starting page where you must press "Start" to begin. 
After that, a new page is opening, with the first Question. You have only 1 correct answer for every question.
In order to see and calculate your correct answers submitted, you can press the button "Check Answer", it will show if the answer is right, otherwise it will
tell you that the answer is incorrect and the right answer.
You cannot submit an question without providing an answer ( correct or not ).
Choosing an answer and submitting it ( pressing the submit and next button ) will forward you to the next question
After answering all the 8 questions, the Result page will show up, telling you the number of correct answers that you provided and the final SCORE.
Each right question  = 5 points.
In the Result page, you can press the button Replay to try again or you can press FINISH to exit the quiz.
Thank you for your time!
